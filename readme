## Introduction

Welcome to Job Portal!

Job Portal is a comprehensive MERN Stack-based web application designed to streamline the job application process. With this platform, users can easily select their roles as applicants or recruiters and create an account hassle-free. We prioritize security and have implemented persistent login sessions, ensuring a smooth user experience.

For added security and privacy, our REST APIs are protected by JWT token verification, providing a secure environment for all users. Recruiters will find the platform exceptionally user-friendly, enabling them to create, delete, and update job listings seamlessly. They can also manage applications by shortlisting, accepting, or rejecting candidates, view resumes, and edit their profiles as needed.
